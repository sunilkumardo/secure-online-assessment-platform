### ðŸ“Œ User Stories

1. **Student Authentication**
   - As a student, I should be able to sign up with OTP, so that my account is secure.
   - As a student, I should be able to log in and view my exam dashboard.

2. **Admin Authentication**
   - As an admin, I should be able to log in, so that I can create/manage exams.

3. **Health Check API**
   - As a developer, I should have a `/api/status` endpoint to verify backend is running.

4. **Database Setup**
   - As a developer, I want MongoDB connected, so that user data and exams can be stored.

5. **Basic UI**
   - As a student, I should see a login page UI.
   - As an admin, I should see a simple dashboard page after login.
